3 observable trends:

1. Charter schools tend to have better test scores on average than district schools.

2. The same goes for smaller schools vs. medium and large, although the difference between small and medium isn't particularly larger.

3. Surprisingly, schools with a lower per student budget outperformed schools with larger budgets.
